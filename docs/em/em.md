title: EM Parameter Optimization of Network Flows for Multiple-Object Tracking
author: Christoph Heindl
date: August, 2021
abstract: In [@zhang2008global] it is mentioned that the parameters of the cost function are optimized in an EM-like manner, without giving further details. In this work, we first argue that a simple EM optimization strategy likely leads to overfitting, which results in poor performance in predicting the number of trajectories on test data. We then present a simple regularization strategy to address this behavior. Finally, we show similarities between our objective function and optimizing the cross-entropy.
